### Exploring the potential of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) collected as part of standard care at a large UK children’s hospital with electronic health records  

#### Project Status: [Ongoing]

#### Project Description

This study reports the different approaches in the collection, storage, access and usage of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) data within a large UK Children’s Hospital (Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust), highlighting that there is great variability in the ability to identify, extract and process PROMs in the de-identified EHR data. 

This repository reports the steps taken to process the PROMs data for further analyses.  

#### Data Source 
NHS REC approval (REC reference:21/LO/0646) and local governance approvals at GOSH (22PE04) were obtained to access routine de-identified EHR data via the GOSH Digital Research Environment (DRE). 

Any observations that mentioned the name of the PROMs (from the list acquired from the Epic Team either in long or abbreviated form) in smart data or flowhsheets (data sets in Epic EHR at GOSH) and any patients with matching observations were included in the data extraction. emographic data were also extracted and linked for patients with identified PROMs from the de-identified EHR data. Due to governamnce processes the data is not available for publication. 

### How does it work?  

The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), The Revised Child Anxiety Depression Scale (RCADs), the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) and the Hospital Anxiety Derpression Scale (HADs) were identified in the EHR data in the DRE. 

The steps taken to process the PROMs data for further analyses were assessed. These steps are iterative but all are needed to succesfully process the data for further analyses.

Each code now presents these steps for the individual PROMs.
